# Elven systemd Tools

No matter how simple the commands, it is almost always worth taking a moment to create some bash scripts to automate the process. Here are three and half scripts that I find useful. They take a moment to setup, but they are very useful.

## modify-service-directory

This script can change the name of the directory in your service file. For instance, if you want to change references to **bcuser** to reference **ubuntu** then use this script. This script will be called automatically by **setup-service**.

Modify the script to reference your service file.

## Setup

Run the JsObjects script called **get-gist** from the root of your project. Choose **Elven Node Tools**. Exit the script. A bunch of files should have been copied into your project.

In **package.json** create script called **start-service** that will start your service without relying on **nodemon** or other problematic services. The minimal possible entry would be:

    "start-service": "npm start",

Or maybe:

    "start-service": "node bin/www",

In **setup-environment-service** modify these lines:

- SYSTEMD_PROJECT_NAME
- DESCRIPTION

For instance:

    export SYSTEMD_PROJECT_NAME=my-project

Now **source** the file:

    source setup-environment-service

Run **setup-service**:

    ./setup-service

Your project might now be running as a service.

## setup-service

This script calls **mod-service**. If that call succeeds, it sets up your service.

Once you have set up your service, you can use these scripts to enable and start the service, or stop and disable the service.

## start-service

Start the service.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

sudo systemctl enable nrb.service
sudo systemctl start nrb.service
```

## stop-service

Stop the service.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

sudo systemctl stop nrb.service
sudo systemctl disable nrb.service
```
